Mod download page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/58489

Easy installation using the FUS Wabbajack automatic installer: https://github.com/Kvitekvist/FUS

# Instructions

The solution to be opened in Visual Studio is `real-virtual-magic-skyrim\sksevr\sksevr.sln`. To be able to compile the mod, the brainflow libraries will have to be added manually. You need to download them from the mod page and put them into the `real-virtual-magic-skyrim\sksevr\RealVirtualMagic\` folder. The mod was so far compiled using VS2019, I don't know if it also works with VS Code but I guess so...
